# GameDevForge

This is the GitHub Pages repo where I host [GameDevForge](https://gamedevforge.net/), a resource for game developers or anyone looking to learn game development.

### What is it?

- A learning resource to learn the very basics of programming and game development up to more advanced principles.
- A blog where I will be posting any interesting/useful features and processes involved with game development.

### Learning to code?

Learning to code is broken down into modules starting with the basic principles up to more advanced topics.\
As the modules progress there will be more specific modules based on game development concepts or specific engines mainly Unreal Engine 5.

### Suggestions

I would love to hear any feedback anyone has about the website or suggestions on things I could include/improve.\
Email me: Lewisscrivens@hotmail.com with the subject GameDevForge so I don't miss it!
