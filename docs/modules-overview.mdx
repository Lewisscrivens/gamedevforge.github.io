# Modules Overview

## What are Modules?

Modules cover a range of topics, from getting started with basic <TextTooltip text="Java"/> to diving into <TextTooltip text="GitHub"/> or <TextTooltip text="C++"/>. They are labeled as beginner, intermediate, or advanced based on how tough they are.

On the left side, you'll see the main modules, like <TextTooltip text="Java"/>. Click on one, and you'll find more folders with smaller sub-modules inside.
Breaking things down like this makes the information much more digestible. Plus, it's handy for more advanced developers who may want a more streamlined experience.

### Introduction

Before diving into the specifics of each module, it's important to understand the structure and core concepts that you will learn throughout.
Each module commences with an introductory page, a high-level explanation of what it entails, the aims, and if relevant, an eviroment setup.

### Core

The modules in general are designed to cover a wide range of core concepts essential for game development. Each module will have Core section(s), covering
fundamental principles ranging from <code>mathematics</code>, <code>coding languages</code>, <code>industry standard practices</code>, <code>software</code>, <code>architecture</code> and the list goes on.

Think of these sections as the building blocks that enable you to tackle a project, or assessment. Quizzes may also be integrated into these sections
to gauge your understanding and proficiency in key concepts.

### Project

The key component is the inclusion of a hands-on project(s). These are carefully crafted to reinforce core concepts and facilitate the practical application of learned skills.
For instance, in the beginner Java module, we kick off with a <TextTooltip text="hello-world"/> project, gradually evolving it into a sophisticated 2D game engine.

Additionally, you may encounter starter projects, serving as learning aids for grasping smaller, bite-sized core concepts, along with a example projects
that solve a given problem proposed in an assessment scenario. This section is pivotal as it transforms theoretical knowledge into tangible skills.

Some modules may not feature a project if it's deemed irrelevant to the module's focus.

### Additional Work

Some modules may also have additional work, this could be extra tasks on a project or a game jam where you can showcase your newfound skills and add a polished project with core concepts to your portfolio.

Additionally, you'll find supplementary learning resources to deepen your exploration of core concepts covered in the module.

### Conclusion

Each module will have closing thoughts and influence to look back on what you have achieved. Summarize what has been covered and offer guidance for the next steps.

By adhering to a structured format and including key components such as core concepts, hands-on projects, and supplementary materials, my hope is for an enriching learning experience for aspiring game developers.

If you are a beginner I highly recommend starting with the <code>**Source Control**</code> page.
