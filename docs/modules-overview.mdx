# Modules Overview

## Introduction

Before diving into the specifics of each module, it's important to understand the structure and core concepts that you will learn throughout.
Each module commences with an introductory page, outlining key practices, practical examples, and a high-level explanation of what it entails.

## Core Concepts

The modules in general are designed to cover a wide range of core concepts essential for game development. Each module will have a Core Concepts section, covering
fundamental principles ranging from <code>mathematics</code>, <code>coding languages</code>, <code>industry standard practices</code>, <code>software</code>, <code>architecture</code> etc.

Think of this section as the building blocks that enable you to tackle a project, quiz or assessment. Quizzes may also be integrated into these sections
to gauge your understanding and proficiency in key concepts.

## Project

The key component is the inclusion of a hands-on project. These projects are carefully crafted to reinforce core concepts and facilitate the practical application of learned skills.
For instance, in the beginner Java module, we kick off with a <code>hello-world</code> project, gradually evolving it into a sophisticated 2D game engine.

Additionally, you may encounter one or more example projects, serving as learning aids for grasping smaller, bite-sized concepts, along with a comprehensive example project
that encapsulates the entirety of the module. This section is pivotal as it transforms theoretical knowledge into tangible skills.

Not all modules will feature a project if it's deemed irrelevant to the module's focus.

## Additional Work

Some modules may also have additional work, this could be extra tasks on a project or a game jam where you can showcase your newfound skills and add a polished project with core concepts to your portfolio.

Additionally, you'll find supplementary learning resources to deepen your exploration of core concepts covered in the module.

## Conclusion

Each module will have closing thoughts and employ you to look back on what you have achieved. Summarize what has been covered and offer guidance for the next steps.

By adhering to a structured format and including key components such as core concepts, hands-on projects, and supplementary materials, my hope is for an enriching learning experience for aspiring game developers.

If you are a beginner I highly recommend starting with the <code>**Portfolio**</code> and <code>**GitHub**</code> pages.
