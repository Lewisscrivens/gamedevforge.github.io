## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of instructing a computer to perform specific tasks by writing instructions, known as code in a given programming language.
Simply put, it is the language we write in to communicate with computers to solve problems, automate tasks, and create software and games.

At its core, programming involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and translating these steps into a language that computers can understand and execute.
It empowers individuals to create solutions to complex problems, ranging from simple calculations to a 3D rendering system for games.
Learning to program not only opens up opportunities for problem-solving and innovation but also provides valuable skills that are increasingly in demand in today's world.

## Why Learn Game Programming?

In today's digital age, gaming is a growing industry. Behind every game lies a team of skilled programmers, designers, and artists who bring an idea to life.
Learning programming, especially in the context of game development, opens up a world of opportunities.

Game development requires a blend of creativity and technical expertise, making it both an exciting and rewarding field, not to mention, the demand for skilled game developers is on the rise.
Whether it's creating immersive worlds, designing engaging gameplay mechanics, or optimizing performance.

Programming is and always will be at the heart of game development, promise I am not bias. ðŸ˜‚
