# Operators

# Operators

Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.

## Types of Operators

Java supports several types of operators, which are:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: These are used to perform basic mathematical operations. Examples include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

- **Relational Operators**: These are used to compare two values. Examples include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

- **Logical Operators**: These are used to perform logical operations (i.e., operations that return a boolean value). Examples include `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

- **Assignment Operators**: These are used to assign a value to a variable. The simplest assignment operator is `=`. Others include `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.

- **Unary Operators**: These are used to perform operations on a single operand. Examples include `++`, `--`, and `!`.

- **Bitwise Operators**: These are used to perform operations on the bits of a number. Examples include `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, and `>>>`.

- **Ternary Operator**: This is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement and is the only operator in Java that works on three operands.

## Examples

Here are some examples of these operators in use:

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

// Arithmetic Operators
System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));  // Addition
System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));  // Subtraction
System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));  // Multiplication
System.out.println("b / a = " + (b / a));  // Division
System.out.println("b % a = " + (b % a));  // Modulus

// Relational Operators
System.out.println("a == b = " + (a == b));  // Equal to
System.out.println("a != b = " + (a != b));  // Not equal to
System.out.println("a > b = " + (a > b));    // Greater than
System.out.println("a < b = " + (a < b));    // Less than
System.out.println("b >= a = " + (b >= a));  // Greater than or equal to
System.out.println("b <= a = " + (b <= a));  // Less than or equal to

// Logical Operators
boolean x = true;
boolean y = false;
System.out.println("x && y = " + (x&&y));  // Logical AND
System.out.println("x || y = " + (x||y));  // Logical OR
System.out.println("!x = " + !x);          // Logical NOT

// Assignment Operators
a += b;
System.out.println("a += b = " + a);  // It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand

// Unary Operators
a++;
System.out.println("a++ = " + a);  // Increment operator increases the value of variable by 1

// Bitwise Operators
System.out.println("a & b = " + (a & b));  // Bitwise AND

// Ternary Operator
int min = (a < b) ? a : b;
System.out.println("min = " + min);  // It returns the minimum between a and b
```
