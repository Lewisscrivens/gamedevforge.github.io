# Operators


In Java, operators are symbols like `+`, `-`, `/`, etc. that perform operations between two values and are fundamental to any programming language.
Without operators, we wouldn't be able to compare values, perform <TextTooltip text="arithmetic"/> operations, or even assign values to variables.
This is done by the usage of symbols to effect <TextTooltip text="operands"/>.

## What are Operands?

In programming terms, operands are the values or variables that operators can perform operations on.
Take the expression `5 + 3` for instance, `5` and `3` are the operands and the `+` symbol is the operator in this scenario.

## Types of Operators

Java supports many types of operators, all with different use cases.
For instance, consider a simple task of checking if a value is equal to 1 and then reacting to that in code by running an action.
This would use both control-flow and a relational operator like so.

```java
int someNumber = 1;
if (someNumber == 1) // == <-- Relational operator.
{
    DoSomething();
}
```

Let's go over all the different types of operators in more detail.

### Arithmetic

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations on two operands, mainly numerical types.
In Java, there are five arithmetic operators:

- ` + ` Addition
    - Adds the two operands together.
- ` - ` Subtraction
    - Subtracts the right operand from the left one.
- ` * ` Multiplication
    - Multiplies the two operands together.
- ` / ` Division
    - Divides the left operand by the right one.
- ` % ` Modulus
    - Returns the remainder of a division operation.

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int addition = a + b; // Result: 15

int subtraction = a - b; // Result: 5

int multiplication = a * b; // Result: 50

int division = a / b; // Result: 2

int modulus = a % b; // Result: 0

// You can also perform operations directly with values as-well
int addValue = a + 20; // Result: 30

```

### Relational

Relational operators are used to compare two operands. In Java, there are six relational operators:

- `==` Equal to
    - Checks if the two operands are equal.
- `!=` Not equal to
    - Checks if the two operands are not equal.
- `>` Greater than
    - Checks if the left operand is greater than the right one.
- `<` Less than
    - Checks if the left operand is less than the right one.
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
    - Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right one.
- `<=` Less than or equal to
    - Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right one.

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

boolean bIsEqual = a == b; // Result: false

boolean bIsNotEqual = a != b; // Result: true

boolean bIsGreaterThan = a > b; // Result: true

boolean bIsLessThan = a < b; // Result: false

boolean bIsGreaterThanOrEqual = a >= b; // Result: true

boolean bIsLessThanOrEqual = a <= b; // Result: false

// You can also perform operations directly with values as-well
boolean bIsEqualValue = a == 10; // Result: true
```

These are mainly used in control-flow structures such as `if` statements, `while`, and `for` loops, where they help determine the
path that the code should take based on certain conditions. We will discuss this in more detail in the control-flow page.

### Logical

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations, typically within conditional statements. In Java, there are three primary logical operators:

- `&&` AND
    - Returns true if both operands are true.
- `||` OR
    - Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
- `!` NOT
    - Returns the inverse of the operand. If the operand is true, it returns false, and vice versa.

```java
boolean bTrue = true;
boolean bFalse = false;

boolean bAnd = bTrue && bFalse; // Result: false

boolean bOr = bTrue || bFalse; // Result: true

boolean bNot = !bTrue; // Result: false
```

Much like the relational operators these are also used typically in control-flow structures to determine paths code should take based on these conditions.

### Assignment

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables of a given data type. In Java, there are several assignment operators:

- `=` Assignment
    - Assigns the value from the right operand to the left operand.
- `+=` Add and assign
    - Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `-=` Subtract and assign
    - Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `*=` Multiply and assign
    - Multiplies the right operand by the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `/=` Divide and assign
    - Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `%=` Modulus and assign
    - Takes the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

a += b; // a = a + b, Result: 15

a -= b; // a = a - b, Result: 10

a *= b; // a = a * b, Result: 50

a /= b; // a = a / b, Result: 10

a %= b; // a = a % b, Result: 0

// You can also perform operations directly with values as-well
a += 20; // a = a + 20, Result: 20
```

### Unary

Unary operators are used to perform operations on a single operand. In Java, there are five primary unary operators:

- `-` Unary minus
    - Negates an expression.
- `++` Increment
    - Increases the value of a variable by 1.
- `--` Decrement
    - Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
- `!` NOT
    - Returns the inverse of the operand. If the operand is true, it returns false, and vice versa.
- `~` Bitwise Complement
    - Inverts all bits in the operand.

:::note

Some of these are duplicates from other operator types because they are also classed as unary operators.

:::

```java
int a = 10;

int unaryMinus = -a; // Result: -10

a++; // a = a + 1, Result: 11

a--; // a = a - 1, Result: 10

boolean bTrue = true;
boolean bNot = !bTrue; // Result: false

int someNumber = 60; // 60 = 0011 1100
int bitwiseComplement = ~someNumber;
// someNumber -> 0011 1100
// Result: -61 = 1100 0011
```

### Bitwise

Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of integer data types.
In Java, there are six bitwise operators:

:::info

These are the hardest operators to grasp and I would suggest they are more towards advanced Java usage, so don't worry about fully grasping these early on.

:::

- `&` AND
    - Performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments.
- `|` OR
    - Performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments.
- `^` XOR
    - Performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation (meaning only 1 of two arguments can be true) on each bit of its integer arguments.
- `~` Complement
    - Unary operator that inverts all bits in the operand.
- `<<` Left shift
    - Shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The leftmost bits are discarded.
- `>>` Right shift
    - Shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The rightmost bits are discarded.

```java
int a = 60; // 60 = 0011 1100
int b = 13; // 13 = 0000 1101

int and = a & b;
// a ->         0011 1100
// b ->         0000 1101
// Result: 12 = 0000 1100

int or = a | b;
// a ->         0011 1100
// b ->         0000 1101
// Result: 61 = 0011 1101

int xOr = a ^ b;
// a ->         0011 1100
// b ->         0000 1101
// Result: 49 = 0011 0001

int complement = ~a;
// a ->          0011 1100
// Result: -61 = 1100 0011

int leftShift = a << 2;
// a ->    0011 1100
// Result: 240 = 1111 0000 - All bits have been shifted 2 places to the left

int rightShift = a >> 2;
// a ->    0011 1100
// Result: 15 = 0000 1111 - All bits have been shifted 2 places to the right
```

### Conditional

The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement and is the only operator in Java that works on three operands.

The operator is represented as ` ? : `

- It starts with a boolean expression (the condition).
- If the condition is true, it returns the value before the `:` (the if part).
- If the condition is false, it returns the value after the `:` (the else part).

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int someResult = (a < b) ? a : b; // Result: 5
// If a is less than b, set SomeResult to a, otherwise; set someResult to b
```

## Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the order that operations are performed when an expression involves multiple operators.
Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.
Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left-right,
except for assignment operators, which are evaluated from right-left.

With the worry of creating a carbon copy from other resources, I don't want to go into too much detail here, if you are
