# Classes

TBD

// Started writing this but putting this in the classes section for now, not sure where it fits yet till I get further along with structure.
## Enumerations

Enumerations, or `enum` in Java, are a special type of class used to define a collection of constants.
They are used when we know all possible values in advance, such as choices on a game settings menu, days of the week, etc.
Think about wanting a custom variable or data type where you can control its possible values.

```java
enum DayOfWeek {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}

DayOfWeek today = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;
```
